# URP Lit Dissolve Shader
This project contains a custom dissolve shader built on Unity’s URP Lit shader. It can be used as a drop-in replacement in any URP project.
The dissolve effect is implemented in the shadow-caster and depth passes as well. Check out an interactive build [here](https://knerten0815.itch.io/urp-lit-dissolve).

## TODO

- DissolveModes:
  - Discard ✅
  - TargetBaseMap
  - Closed mesh?
- Check Optimizations:
  - use Object Space instead of World Space
